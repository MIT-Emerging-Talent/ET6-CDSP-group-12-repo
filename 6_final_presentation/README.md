## Section Summaries

### 1. Introduction, Problem & Research Question (30s)

- Migrants and refugees often lack access to banking, insurance, or credit due to insufficient documentation or lack of credit history.
- Our core question:  
  **‚ÄúCan blockchain-enabled credit tools serve as viable alternatives for financial inclusion among migrants and refugees?‚Äù**

### 2. Datasets Used & Analysis (40s)

- **Data Sources**:  
  - *Global Crypto Adoption Index (2022‚Äì2024)* ‚Äì broad measures of everyday cryptocurrency usage.  
  - *International Migrant Stock (2024)* ‚Äì counts of migrant populations by country/region.  
- **Analysis Highlights**:  
  - Mapped migration and crypto adoption at the country and region levels.  
  - Faced some limitations: regional standardization was manual; crypto data tracks rankings, not precise volumes.

### 3. Findings, Conclusions & Website (50s)

- **Country Examples**:  
  - High overlap: Philippines, India, Ukraine, the USA, Gulf states.  
- **Regional Insights**:  
  - Moderate positive correlation between migrant population and crypto adoption emerges‚Äîthough with notable exceptions (e.g., Western Europe).  
- **Conclusion**: Blockchain-based financial services may offer practical, inclusive credit alternatives for displaced and underserved populations.  
- **Explore More**:  
  To make our results accessible, we created an **interactive website** with visualizations and insights.
