# 📘 Research Project: Blockchain-Based Credit Systems for Migrant Financial Inclusion

## 🔍 Research Focus

**Can blockchain-based identity and credit systems provide a viable solution to financial exclusion among migrants and refugees who lack access to traditional banking services?**

This project explores how blockchain and alternative data sources—such as mobile phone usage, remittance patterns, and on-chain transaction histories—can be used to assess creditworthiness and unlock access to essential financial services for underserved migrant communities.

## 🧩 Key Concepts

* **Financial Exclusion**: Migrants and refugees often lack credit histories or documentation, limiting access to banking.
* **Alternative Data**: Mobile usage, remittances, and digital footprints can provide behavioral indicators of creditworthiness.
* **Blockchain Technology**: Decentralized, tamper-proof systems offer transparent and portable digital identities.
* **AI-Driven Credit Scoring**: Models that leverage non-traditional data to assess trustworthiness and risk.
* **On-Chain Analytics**: Use of blockchain metadata to detect fraud and predict default.
* **Ethical Design**: Ensuring privacy, consent, fairness, and accessibility in fintech solutions.

## ⚙️ Technical Approach

Our approach is focused on testing blockchain and AI models using available alternative datasets. We will:

* Simulate credit scoring using mobile usage, remittance flows, and on-chain data
* Build on-chain risk profiling models to detect anomalies and fraud
* Benchmark blockchain-native credit systems against traditional ones
* Analyze inclusion impacts, model transparency, and ethical tradeoffs

---

## 🧪 Methodology Summary

* **Data Collection**: Mobile metadata, blockchain transactions, public remittance data
* **Feature Engineering**: Wallet lifespan, network participation, behavioral signals
* **Modeling**: Credit scoring using ML, graph theory, and decision trees
* **Validation**: Compare results to known credit profiles or real-world inclusion outcomes
* **Ethical Guardrails**: Fairness audits, consent frameworks, privacy layers
