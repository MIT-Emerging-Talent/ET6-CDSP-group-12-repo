## Project Overview

This collaborative research project explores whether **blockchain-based credit and financial solutions** can offer a **viable path to financial inclusion** for **migrants and refugees**, who are often shut out of traditional banking services due to the lack of formal documentation or credit histories.

---

## Problem Statement

Migrants and refugees frequently face **systemic barriers to financial
services**—from bank accounts and credit access to insurance—due to limited or
non-existent formal credit records, identity papers, or residency status. Conventional
financial systems often fail to serve this population, contributing to economic
marginalization and social exclusion.

This project investigates the potential of **blockchain technology**—with its
decentralized, secure, and tamper-resistant capabilities—to provide **alternative financial solutions** that could enable fairer, more inclusive access to banking and credit.
