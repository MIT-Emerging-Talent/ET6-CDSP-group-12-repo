# Milestone Dataset 1: Blockchain-Based Credit Systems for Migrant Financial Inclusion

## Project Context

This repository supports our group research project for the MIT Emerging Talent – Computational Thinking & Data Science Program. Our central research question investigates whether **blockchain-based identity and credit scoring systems** can help address **financial exclusion among migrants and refugees**, particularly those who lack access to formal financial institutions due to missing documentation, limited credit history, or regulatory barriers.

## Contents of Dataset Milestone

We have compiled and organized data sources into three documentation files, along with a shared Google Drive folder containing all original datasets and supporting documents.

### 📂 RAWDATA.md  

This file summarizes the **raw datasets** used in our research. It includes links, brief descriptions, and source information for each dataset related to migrant demographics, financial inclusion, and decentralized technology systems.  

- The folder `raw_datasets_files` contains the raw datasets used for our research into whether blockchain-based identity and credit systems can help address financial exclusion among migrants and refugees. As per the repository guidelines, these files are kept in their **original, unmodified state**.

## Selection and Validation Approach

We used the **FRESCO framework** to guide dataset selection:

- **Feasible**: Publicly available, well-documented, and analyzable formats.
- **Relevant**: Focused on blockchain, identity, migrant credit access, and financial inclusion.
- **Ethical**: Sourced from official or reputable open data portals, respecting privacy and usage guidelines.
- **Specific**: Aligned with our clearly defined research question.
- **Collaborative**: Designed for group analysis and reproducibility.
- **Original**: Contains innovative angles and underexplored intersections between technology and migration finance.
