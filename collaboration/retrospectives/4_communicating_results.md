# 🔄 Retrospective

This document reflects on our team’s experience during **Milestone 4_communication_strategy** of CDSP.  
It outlines what we should stop, continue, and start doing, lessons learned, and a comparison between our planned strategy and actual execution.

---

## 🛑 Stop Doing
* Waiting until only a few days before submission to begin work on the milestone, which left little time for iteration.
* Depending on one or two people to drive the creation and finalization of communication artifacts under time pressure.
* Assuming that technical clarity automatically translates into audience understanding without deliberate simplification.
* Underestimating the time needed for creative design and format decisions—especially when not everyone could join the planning meeting.

---

## ✅ Continue Doing
* Using collaborative tools (Docs, Slides, shared boards) to co-create content in real time.
* Holding milestone-end reflections to identify what worked and what can be improved.
* Assigning initial roles for content creation, audience research, and artifact design.
* Reviewing deliverables against the milestone’s learning objectives before submission.
* Encouraging feedback rounds within the group to refine messaging.

---

## 🆕 Start Doing
* Conducting early discussions on the **audience’s capabilities and constraints** before drafting messages.
* Building simple storyboards or mockups early to visualize the final artifact.
* Scheduling progress check-ins specifically for communication design and messaging clarity.
* Allocating dedicated time to practice translating technical findings into plain language.
* Incorporating uncertainty statements in a way that is understandable yet constructive for the audience.

---

## 🎯 Strategy vs. Execution

### ✅ What went as planned?
* We successfully identified and described a well-defined target audience.
* We produced a communication artifact aligned with the audience’s needs and context.
* We conveyed the limits of our results and included sources of uncertainty in an accessible format.
* Our document clearly outlined how we intended to reach our audience and what we wanted them to learn.

### ❌ What didn’t go as planned?
* We waited until only a few days before the deadline to begin focused work on the milestone, which created time pressure and reduced opportunities for iteration.
* Not everyone could attend the key planning meeting, which limited early collaboration and alignment on the artifact’s direction.
* The workload ended up being uneven, with a small number of members handling most of the final communication artifact creation.
* Deciding on the most effective communication medium took longer than expected, further compressing the design timeline.
* Translating statistical findings into plain language and actionable advice required more time and group discussion than we had available.

**Lessons learned:**  
This milestone emphasized that **effective science communication is as much about empathy and creativity as it is about accuracy**. Even when the data is correct, the message can fall flat if it’s not shaped for the audience’s understanding and constraints. Going forward, we aim to integrate audience-focused thinking earlier in the process and to prototype communication artifacts sooner to allow for feedback and iteration.
