# üîÑ Retrospective

This document reflects on our team‚Äôs experience during **Milestone 3\_data\_analysis** of CDSP.
It outlines what we should stop, continue, and start doing, lessons learned,
and a comparison between our planned strategy and actual execution.

---

## üõë Stop Doing

* Allowing analysis tasks to become centralized in the hands of one or two individuals
* Avoiding accountability for technical tasks by assuming others will handle them
* Moving ahead with work without regularly syncing as a team

---

## ‚úÖ Continue Doing

* Using shared documents and communication platforms to document progress
* Reflecting on blockers and gaps at the end of each milestone
* Setting goals for each phase and assigning initial roles
* Maintaining organized datasets and analysis-ready files
* Reviewing dataset quality and relevance before analysis begins

---

## üÜï Start Doing

* Actively distributing technical tasks (e.g., analysis, visualization) at the start of the milestone
* Conducting short technical syncs to check analysis progress and clarify blockers
* Supporting team members who may be less confident in data tools or scripting
* Establishing collaborative coding spaces from the beginning

---

## üéØ Strategy vs. Execution

### ‚úÖ What went as planned?

* We successfully transitioned cleaned datasets from Milestone 2 into the analysis phase
* Some initial exploratory data analysis and basic visualizations were completed
* A few relevant insights were extracted to support our research questions

### ‚ùå What didn‚Äôt go as planned?

* The workload was not evenly distributed‚Äî**most of the analysis was completed by one member**,
  while others were less engaged or unclear on their roles
* We lacked technical check-ins, which led to communication gaps and siloed progress

## üë§ Individual Retrospectives

### üß† Mukuna Kabeya

In this milestone, I participated in the data preparation and early analysis stages, reviewing datasets for consistency, identifying missing values, and helping to shape initial insights. My contributions supported the team‚Äôs efforts to build a foundation for more in-depth exploration.

A key challenge during this phase was the uneven distribution of technical tasks and limited collaboration across the team. With a significant portion of the analysis completed by a single member, opportunities for shared learning and group engagement were reduced.

This experience highlighted the importance of balanced participation and regular coordination, especially during complex milestones. Moving forward, I aim to take a more active role in promoting shared ownership of technical work and ensuring that all members are supported and involved throughout the process.

### üß† Hasan Zemzem

During this milestone, I shifted from data sourcing to supporting the transition from raw data to meaningful analysis. I reviewed how the datasets we previously documented were being used in analysis and checked whether our earlier metadata and summaries still aligned with the analytical goals of the project.

Although I was not directly involved in scripting or performing analysis, I contributed by helping the team trace original data sources, understand dataset structures, and resolve confusion around variable definitions. I also identified cases where additional context from documentation was needed to interpret results correctly.

This milestone deepened my appreciation for the link between data documentation and analysis clarity. Clear, structured data sourcing upfront makes a significant difference when the team enters technical phases. Moving forward, I hope to become more hands-on with tools like Jupyter or Python to directly contribute to data exploration.

### üß† √ñzg√ºr

In this milestone, I supported the analysis process by ensuring that the datasets selected during earlier phases were properly aligned with our research objectives. I revisited the metadata and dataset summaries we had built, checking for alignment with the analytical narratives we were forming.

I also participated in discussions on how best to frame analytical outputs using the datasets we had previously validated. While I didn‚Äôt carry out code-based analysis myself, I helped ensure that the research logic and thematic focus‚Äîblockchain, identity, and financial inclusion‚Äîremained central to how we interpreted the data.

This experience helped me understand the value of strategic alignment between data selection and analysis framing. In future milestones, I aim to improve my technical fluency so I can participate more directly in the hands-on work of transforming data into insights.

### üß† Mohammed Elfadil Rabie Hussien

In this milestone, I was primarily involved in the technical execution of data analysis and visualization. My tasks included cleaning and preparing datasets, writing scripts to explore key patterns, and generating visual outputs to support our research on blockchain-based identity and financial inclusion.

Through this work, I gained valuable experience in managing real-world data and extracting insights that align with our project goals. However, a key challenge was the limited distribution of technical tasks, which led to heavier responsibilities falling on fewer team members. This affected our overall workflow and limited opportunities for peer collaboration.

This milestone highlighted the importance of balanced task sharing and ongoing technical communication. Moving forward, I hope we can work more collaboratively on code-based tasks, promote shared learning, and ensure everyone contributes meaningfully across different phases.

### üß† Mohammad Ziadah

In this milestone, I continued supporting the team by focusing on validating data integrity and contextual accuracy as we transitioned into the analysis phase. I reviewed the datasets being analyzed to ensure they aligned with our original research focus‚Äîspecifically the intersection of migration, blockchain-based identity systems, and financial inclusion.

My contribution involved helping identify inconsistencies or outdated entries and flagging issues where the dataset's relevance to our research was unclear. While I wasn‚Äôt directly involved in coding or scripting, I contributed by giving critical feedback on data suitability, which informed how some analyses were framed.

This milestone reminded me that data analysis is only as strong as the quality and relevance of the input, and that having team members focused on contextual validation is equally important in multidisciplinary projects like ours.

### üß† Svitlana Musiienko

During this milestone, my focus shifted toward ensuring the datasets were technically ready for analysis. This involved checking column formats, fixing minor structural inconsistencies, and assisting in the preparation of documentation that clarified data sources, variable meanings, and usage constraints.

I helped bridge the gap between data collection and analysis by making sure our cleaned files were consistent, properly named, and compatible with our analysis tools. Although I wasn‚Äôt directly writing analytical code, I supported the team by flagging missing values and helping document the limitations of specific datasets.

This experience reinforced the importance of data hygiene and structure‚Äîeven small formatting issues can significantly disrupt analysis. Going forward, I want to deepen my skills in data wrangling so I can contribute more directly during technical stages as well.
