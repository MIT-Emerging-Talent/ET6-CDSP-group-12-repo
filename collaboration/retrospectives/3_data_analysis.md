# 🔄 Retrospective

This document reflects on our team’s experience during **Milestone 3\_data\_analysis** of CDSP.
It outlines what we should stop, continue, and start doing, lessons learned,
and a comparison between our planned strategy and actual execution.

---

## 🛑 Stop Doing

* Allowing analysis tasks to become centralized in the hands of one or two individuals
* Avoiding accountability for technical tasks by assuming others will handle them
* Moving ahead with work without regularly syncing as a team

---

## ✅ Continue Doing

* Using shared documents and communication platforms to document progress
* Reflecting on blockers and gaps at the end of each milestone
* Setting goals for each phase and assigning initial roles
* Maintaining organized datasets and analysis-ready files
* Reviewing dataset quality and relevance before analysis begins

---

## 🆕 Start Doing

* Actively distributing technical tasks (e.g., analysis, visualization) at the start of the milestone
* Conducting short technical syncs to check analysis progress and clarify blockers
* Supporting team members who may be less confident in data tools or scripting
* Establishing collaborative coding spaces from the beginning

---

## 🎯 Strategy vs. Execution

### ✅ What went as planned?

* We successfully transitioned cleaned datasets from Milestone 2 into the analysis phase
* Some initial exploratory data analysis and basic visualizations were completed
* A few relevant insights were extracted to support our research questions

### ❌ What didn’t go as planned?

* The workload was not evenly distributed—**most of the analysis was completed by one member**,
  while others were less engaged or unclear on their roles
* We lacked technical check-ins, which led to communication gaps and siloed progress

This experience reinforced the importance of data hygiene and structure—even small formatting issues can significantly disrupt analysis. Going forward, I want to deepen my skills in data wrangling so I can contribute more directly during technical stages as well.
