## üìù Introduction

Globally, millions of migrants and refugees face systemic barriers in accessing loans and other financial services due to lack of credit history, incomplete identification documents, or limited banking infrastructure in host countries. The **Blockchain for Migrants** project explores the potential of blockchain-based financial tools as an alternative to traditional credit systems, bridging this gap and enabling financial inclusion for underserved populations.

## ‚ö† Problem Statement

Traditional credit scoring relies on centralized financial histories, which migrants often lack. This creates a **‚Äúcredit invisibility‚Äù** problem, even for individuals with stable income, responsible payment habits, and viable business opportunities.  
We sought to answer:

- Can blockchain technology provide secure, verifiable, and portable credit profiles for migrants?
- How can these profiles be used by financial institutions to assess creditworthiness fairly and efficiently?

## üî¨ Methodology

- **Data Collection:** Reviewed academic literature, policy reports, and datasets on migrant financial inclusion, digital identity, and blockchain applications.
- Used **Global Crypto Adoption Index (2022‚Äì2024)** to measure grassroots use of cryptocurrency (retail, DeFi, centralized exchanges).
- Used **International Migrant Stock (2024)** dataset to measure the total number of international migrants residing in each global region.

## üìä Our Team Findings

### üåé By Countries

Using global cryptocurrency adoption rankings, top adoption countries in recent years are **Vietnam, Philippines, Ukraine, India, and the United States**.

**Notable overlaps include:**

- **United States** - high crypto adoption + high migrant stock.
- **Philippines & India** - strong crypto usage + significant outbound and inbound migration flows.
- **Ukraine** ‚Äì notable in crypto activity and large migrant/displaced population.
- **Gulf States (UAE, Saudi Arabia)** - not top in adoption rankings but high migrant worker populations and growing fintech adoption.

**Opportunities by Countries:**

- Countries with both strong crypto adoption and significant migrant presence could be ideal pilot locations for blockchain-based credit scoring.
- Regions with high migration but lower adoption rates may require parallel efforts in digital literacy and infrastructure building.

### üåé By Regions

International migration data shows high migrant populations in **Sub-Saharan Africa, Northern Africa, Eastern Europe, and Western Asia**.  
Some countries with large migrant communities also rank well in crypto adoption, suggesting readiness for blockchain financial solutions.

**Opportunities by Region:**
**High Priority Regions:**

- Central & Southern Asia and Oceania - top adoption countries + migrant presence.
- Eastern Europe - mix of conflict-driven migration and crypto growth.
- North America - mature systems but potential for alternative credit for migrants.

**Growth Potential Regions:**

- Sub-Saharan Africa - high migration, emerging crypto adoption.
- Southern Europe - gateway migration region with potential for fintech scaling.

## üí° Insights

Our findings suggest a **moderate positive relationship** between international migrant populations and cryptocurrency adoption (excluding outliers like Central & Western Europe).  
These insights support the hypothesis that **blockchain-based financial tools** can be a viable alternative to traditional credit systems ‚Äî especially in underserved regions. Migrants in these areas may adopt decentralized platforms that bypass the need for traditional credit histories, fostering financial inclusion.
