Dear ____________,

We are a part of the MIT Emerging Talent - Data Science Cohort 6, where our team **FinclusionChain** recently completed research on how blockchain-based financial tools could help migrants and refugees overcome barriers to accessing loans and credit.

Our study analyzed global cryptocurrency adoption trends alongside international migrant stock data to identify regions and countries where blockchain solutions could have the greatest impact. The findings highlight:

- Regions and countries combining high migrant populations with strong cryptocurrency adoption.
- Opportunities for digital credit profiles to address “credit invisibility” among migrants.
- Priority areas where blockchain-based credit systems could advance financial inclusion.

We believe these insights could be useful to your work and to others in the humanitarian and financial inclusion space.

Attached, you’ll find our **Research Findings Brief** - we welcome you to share it with relevant stakeholders, community leaders, and decision-makers who may benefit from this information.

Thank you for your time, and for the important work you do to support vulnerable communities worldwide.

Warm regards,  
MIT Emerging Talent – Data Science Cohort 6
