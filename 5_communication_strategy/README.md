# Communication Strategy

## Outreach Approach

Our outreach strategy focuses on building meaningful connections with both
**organizations** and **individual innovators** who share our mission of
improving financial inclusion for migrants. We aim to bridge the gap between
institutional influence and entrepreneurial innovation by engaging stakeholders
who are actively developing solutions in digital identity, alternative credit
scoring, and financial access.

To achieve this, we have prepared:

- A **research findings brief** summarizing our work, which will serve as an
  introduction to our project and highlight the insights we have gathered:  
  üìÑ [Research Findings Brief](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-12-repo/blob/main/5_communication_strategy/research_findings_brief.md)
- An **email template** to standardize our communication with organizations and ensure clarity and professionalism:
