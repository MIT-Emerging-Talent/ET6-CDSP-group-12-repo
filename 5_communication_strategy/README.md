# Communication Strategy

## Outreach Approach

Our outreach strategy focuses on building meaningful connections with both
**organizations** and **individual innovators** who share our mission of
improving financial inclusion for migrants. We aim to bridge the gap between
institutional influence and entrepreneurial innovation by engaging stakeholders
who are actively developing solutions in digital identity, alternative credit
scoring, and financial access.

To achieve this, we have prepared:

- A **research findings brief** summarizing our work, which serves as an
introduction to our project and highlights the insights we have gathered:  
üìÑ [Research Findings Brief](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-12-repo/blob/main/5_communication_strategy/research_findings_brief.md)

- An **email template** to standardize our communication with organizations and ensure clarity and professionalism:  
  üìÑ [Email Template](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-12-repo/blob/main/5_communication_strategy/email_template.md)

- A **public-facing website** that showcases our research in a clear, accessible, and interactive way.

### Why the Website Matters

The website is a crucial part of our communication strategy. While the research brief and email template are aimed at **professional stakeholders**, the website allows us to:

- **Reach a broader audience**: NGOs, policymakers, journalists, students, and the general public can explore our findings without needing technical or academic expertise.  
- **Visualize complex data**: Our interactive charts make it easy to understand the relationship between migration patterns and cryptocurrency adoption across regions.  
- **Engage users interactively**: Visitors can explore country-level data, see adoption vs. migration correlations, and compare regional differences in financial access.  
- **Enhance credibility and transparency**: Hosting the project on GitHub Pages ensures open access and demonstrates that our work is grounded in real data and analysis.  

By combining research, storytelling, and visualization, the website helps us **bridge the gap between data and impact**‚Äîmaking our project more relatable and actionable for a global audience.
